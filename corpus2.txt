music neg 241.txt i bought this album because i loved the title song . it 's such a great song , how bad can the rest of the album be , right ? well , the rest of the songs are just filler and are n't worth the money i paid for this . it 's either shameless bubblegum or oversentimentalized depressing tripe . kenny chesney is a popular artist and as a result he is in the cookie cutter category of the nashville music scene . he 's gotta pump out the albums so the record company can keep lining their pockets while the suckers out there keep buying this garbage to perpetuate more garbage coming out of that town . i 'll get down off my soapbox now . but country music really needs to get back to it 's roots and stop this pop nonsense . what country music really is and what it is considered to be by mainstream are two different things .

camera neg 715.txt in my experience , this camera takes great pictures , but the zoom lens is so delicate that it breaks easily . it stops extending and just makes a clicking noise . this happened to me when the camera accidentally turned on while in my pants pocket rendering the camera unusable . my brother and two of my friends experienced a similar problem with their ex-s500 after they accidentally dropped the camera while the lens was extended . i would recommend looking into another camera that is not so delicate 
books neg 120.txt first off i 'd like to tell you that this is only the second star wars book i 've ever read , ' jedi search ' being the first . i actually liked the first book , it drew upon the star wars lore well and was a decent read . however , this book made me groan in so many places that i felt almost compelled to create an account here to have a little rant about it ( be warned , this may contain a few spoilers ) . thusly : how much of the book was wasted with overly long descriptions ? it reminds me of a ' little britain ' sketch where a woman author is dictating her new book and starts reading the bible out to make up the space ! i do n't mind the story being 20-odd pages shorter if it comes to the point ! for some bizarre reason the author seems to have taken every opportunity to ' ground ' the story by constantly relating to the star wars films . for example , when wedge and the scientist go to that forest-resort planet and meet the alien ambassador there , he says something along the lines of : i was actually in the cantina in mos eisley when luke met han and chewbacca , little did i know the brush i had with history there... . gahhhhhhh ! ! ! why ! ? how did he know ! ? it did n't need it ! ! *bangs head on desk* he does this throughout the two books i 've read so far ! ! how about the will to stick your own neck out and come up with something new without ' proving ' that it 's true by telling the readers that it was from a certain scene in one of the films ? then there 's admiral daala . made an admiral because of her brilliant military skills and quick thinking... . so what is she doing in this ? she 's reviewing recordings of speeches given by tarkin over military tactics and following them to the letter and losing ! it 's only the end of the second book and she 's down to 1 star destroyer ! she should live up to her reputation and at least have a few successful campaigns before the inevitable happens . ( i.e. the rebellion win ) he then goes on to waste an absolutely brilliant idea , that of having a jedi academy ( the point of the trilogy ! ) . there 's so much that could have been done here - new and original training for the jedi , but no - he has the jedi go two-by-two into the forest ( holding hands ? ) to *sense* things.. . it 's meant to be a sci-fi series ! something could have been done to make this so much better ! i was incensed to find that luke was actually made ' boring ' in this book . part of my motivation for starting to read the series in the first place was to see how luke had grown . it all started very promisingly in the first book , having learnt that luke had turned to the dark side and come through it all with the love of his friends and was now more powerful than ever ! ( cool ! i thought ) . it got to the stage where i 'd dread coming back to the jedi parts of the story because he was so dull . the other trainee jedi needed serious character development ( they were 1 dimensional ! ) - entering every scene with luke surveying them noting how well they were progressing just was n't good enough . as other reviewers have said - one of his students goes rogue , somehow gains the knowledge of building a super-lightsabre ( great idea btw ! ! we need more of that ! ) then is discovered burnt to death in his quarters.. . and luke just meditates about it ! ? *grr* okay all that being said it was ' okay ' and on the strength of the first book i will be reading the next book ( it 's like a car accident - you 've just got to look ! ) . 
health pos 80.txt this is a very good shaver for the private area . however , the key to getting the best results is to trim the longer hairs with scissors or the largest guard first . this will keep the shaver from pulling on the longer hairs and will enable the foil part of the shaver to work . the foil will not be able to do its job if the hairs are too long . the only problem i had with the shaver was that it did not enable me to shave my back like it claimed . however , i use the ' mangroomer ' back shaver for this and it is perfect for you to shave off all your back hair easily with its elongated handle . it is a great product as well . therefore , i would have to say these two products coupled together seem to cover all the bases for men 's grooming on the body . i would highly recommend both of them for perfect manscaping results

health pos 153.txt i just got my first case of this fabric softener last week and yesterday , i was walking downstairs when the smell of lavender hit me - i was surprised because i had n't sprayed any lavender freshener in the air , when i realized that my boyfriend was doing a load of laundry . like seventh generation 's lavender laundry detergent , i love this product - if you use them in tandem , not only do your clothes smell like *real* lavender ( not the chemically-based smells of mainstream products ) , but they come out clean and soft . i especially like the lavender smell for my sheets and blankets and it 's gentle enough to use on my baby 's clothes , too ! i love that it 's made with natural products and real lavender essential oil . it 's also safe for my septic system , so i 'm sold on this product . if you 're sensitive to the chemical-based scents of the mainstream fabric softeners or ca n't find one that smells good to you , try this one !

camera pos 6.txt i believe this is one of the best lens for about $1000. forget about zoom lenses even if they are l . this lens is far better than 70-200l in my opinion . it is very sharp at f2 and even more sharp at f2.5. with zoom lenses you have to set to f / 5.6 for better result and f / 8 to match this lens . it is very well built but not excessive heavy , come with hood and bag , but unfortunately , canon have decided to remove the hard cases for all the l lenses . combined with a tamron 1.4x teleconverter this lens provide very good optical quality on par with any zoom l lenses at 189mm focal length . yes i know i lost the convenience of a 70-200 zoom lens . but i am really happy that i decide to change the plan of buying a 70-200is to 135 / 2l+1.4x . this not only saves me the money but also let me to get better pictures , especially at wide open . better portrait lenses , like 200 / 1.8 and 300 / 2.8 , would cost several thousands of dollars . trust me , once you play with primes , you will not like zoom anymore . i am also using a 24-70l to shoot my small kid . after using this lens , i do n't like it anymore and thinking about change to primes someday , the only reason preventing me doing that is the 1.6x crop factor of digital camera . a 35mm / 1.4l will become 56mm which is really not good . order from amazon with free shipping even though it says not in stock . they shipped mine in 2 days and this happened before even though item stated " in stock soon " . pros : very sharp at f2 and super sharp start from f2.5. very fast lens with f / 2 very good bokeh ( background blurring ) . overall extremely good picture quality with good contrast / color . smaller size , less weight and black color compare to those white 70-200s . it is a l lens : best build quality , fast / quiet ring usm af with ftm . cons : no hard case . no inexpensive . effective focal length is 216mm on 10d / 20d / rebel / 300d which is a little difficult to use for portrait

software pos 439.txt our photo and video editing softwares were both very basic and " old " , so we decided to upgrade a couple of months ago . after reading many reviews on different bundles , we decided to get the adobe photoshop elements 5.0 premiere elements 3.0 bundle . we 've played around with the premiere elements a bit , and it 's really awesome . much better than the pinnacle studio 8 we had before . all the basic functions are easy to use and very intuitive , though we have n't gone and figured out the more advanced features yet . the photoshop elements is a wonderful tool , as well . we recently had to scan in a lot of old pictures ( as in 20+ year old b / w photographs ) . they needed a lot of touching up , and elements 5.0 worked wonderfully for that . i could adjust the lighting and sharpening , fix the colors and scratches , and the pictures turned out amazing . you 'd never be able to tell they were scanned images from such old photographs . the program is also very intuitive . i could do all the things i wanted to do without having to read the manual . of course , i 'm still just touching on the surface of what all is possible , and i plan on reading the manual and studying the program in more detail once i have the time to do so , but for what i need right now , it 's easy to use and does a good job . there are only two things i have to comment on that i do n't like about the adobe bundle , and they are the reason why i 'm giving 4 stars instead of 5. 1. the stated minimum requirements for this bundle are 512mb ram . that 's what we had on our computer , and while the program worked , it was so painfully slow that it was n't feasible to really use it . we ended up upgrading to 1gb , and it 's been working great since . so if you have less than 1gb ram , make sure you upgrade before getting this software ! 2. the red-eye fix in photoshop elements , or lack thereof . there is an auto red-eye fix , but it does n't work very well . it finds red eyes in all kinds of places , just not where they actually are . sometimes it covers half the face , sometimes only half of the eye , etc. etc. etc. there is an option to manually show the program where the red eye is , but it still does n't work right . maybe there 's another trick i have n't found out about yet , but as of right now , i usually give the fix tool a shot , and if it does n't work i take the picture back into my old editing software and fix the red eye there . i 'm really very disappointed with this , as fixing red eyes is something you have to do quite frequently when editing pictures . overall , the software has been very easy and fun to work with , even for an amateur like me . :o ) if adobe can adjust the minimum requirements recommendation and fix the red-eye fix tool , it 's going to definitely deserve 5 points

camera pos 30.txt i shoot with a canon 20d and have used the canon ef 75-300mm f / 4.5-5.6 iii usm lens . i 've always noticed the limitations of this lens when shooting amateur softball . i reviewed the lens lineup at the canon website and decided on the canon ef 100-400mm f / 4.5-5.6l usm lens . the 100-400mm is a great lens , but it can be a bit soft . for that reason i decided to add the canon ef 70-200mm 2.8 / f is usm telephoto zoom lens to my lens collection . this is a serious lens meant for serious photographers . being an l lens , there is a lot of features and is manufactured with better materials with a high level of dust and moisture resistance . the construction is sturdy and consists of 23 elements in 18 groups . the four super ud-glass elements largely eliminate the secondary spectrum reducing residual chromatic aberration . an improved 8-blade circular aperture offers a more pleasing out-of-focus image . the canon ef 70-200mm lens weighs in at about 3.24 lbs / 1 , 470 g , and accepts 77mm filters with a minimal focusing distance of 4.3 ft / 1.3 m. this lens is compatible with the extenders 1.4x ii and 2x ii . be sure to get a good quality uv haze filter to protect the front lens element . being white , this lens looks a bit strange , but helps keep it stay cool when shooting in the sun . some people are concerned that being white , it attracts attention to criminals . from my experience , my 20d attracts attention regardless of what lens i put on it . in addition , i most likely have a camera bag and tripod / monopod with me to further attract attention . i personally doubt a thief looking for something to steal is taking the time to evaluate the cost of the item and are more concerned with the ease of taking something they can unload . i try to make things difficult for would be thieves and have insurance as a back up . the dual is system has two modes . mode 1 is for stationary subjects while mode two is for moving subjects . it is recommended that the is function is not used on a tripod ; however i have used it on my monopod with success . the is helps to eliminate camera shake and helps stabilize the lens when shooting from a moving vehicle . while there are limitations to what the is can do , it can give you a few extra stops . just keep in mind , the is attempts to eliminate camera movement , not the movement of the subject being photographed . this lens permits for auto or manual focus depending on how the switch is set . there is also a switch to shift from a 1.4m / 4.6ft to infinity or 2.5m / 8.2ft to infinity . included with this lens are the tripod mount , lens hood , and storage case . the tripod mount is the best option to use when mounting to a tripod . this helps to balance the load . mounting the camera instead creates an unbalanced set up that may topple over . the case is a zippered soft case ( lz1324 ) that can also be purchased separately . the lens hood ( et-86 ) is used to reduce lens flare and can protect the front element in certain situations . often times , amazon recommends purchasing the lens case and hood , however they are normally included with the lens . the canon ef 70-200mm is such an awesome lens , it almost fails to compare to the canon ef 75-300mm . the canon 100-400mm lens is a well used option for me , but the clarity and sharpness of the 70-200mm is lens is more refined . the auto-focus is quiet and quick . this lens can be used for portraits , landscape , sports or as a general walk about lens . the f / 2.8l combined with the is makes this a good option for certain low light situations . the features add creative versatility . the canon ef 70-200mm is lens comes at a price , but it is worth every bit of it . pros : incredible clarity and sharpness quiet and quick auto-focus features add creative versatility dual is system cons : heavy and bulky ( this should be expected with these types of lenses

books neg 52.txt this book was on a very interseting topic . the author took time in studying this topic . it was about the impending world oil shortage . that is the time when we , the world , will run out of oil . it tells you about hubbert 's analysis of the time or year when the world will run out of oil . they then talk about a lot of other things like where oil comes from . then they talk about where oil is . they also talk about drilling for oil . they say it takes people over 20 drills to find oil . sometimes it will take even more time then that . then they talk about the size of oil fields . they also reexamine hubbert 's analysis later on in the book . rate plots is brought up because the more people driving the less oil we will have in the future . they talk about the future to fossil fuels and discuss elctricity and natural gases . they also talk about how much we already have so when oil runs out we need to think about all the stuff we already have . hubbert was a brilliant man . some gas companys tried to make him stay quiet but he did n't want to he told everybody . the author was ver knowledgable and i could tell he knew what he was talking about . i would n't recommend this book to anybody unless they are very smart and want to know about the impending world oil shortage . i say again the author took time in studying this topic but that was his downfall in that he went into to much depth and made it boring . when you read it you can tell the author knew what he was talking about but he got to much into detail which is very boring . i gave it a low rating because i have a short attenion span so it was hard enough for me to make it through this book

dvd pos 168.txt i 'm told by fellow film enthusiasts that buuel 's later films do not show this spanish master at his best , that his earliest films- --his famous collaborations with salvador dal , for instance- --show an edgier , more fascinating buuel . whatever . i saw his 1974 film the phantom of liberty for the first time recently , and i immediately fell in love with it . there are those who swear by his more popular 1972 oscar-winner the discreet charm of the bourgeoisie , but somehow i think the phantom of liberty is even more entertaining than discreet charm . there is no plot to speak of in phantom : this film is basically a collection of surrealist sketches that finds buuel playing with all kinds of different ideas and different images . monks pray for a woman 's sick father , and then play poker with the woman and smoke . a group of people sit around a dinner table on toilets , and go to the bathroom to eat in private . two parents desperately try to find their missing daughter- --even though she 's right there in class when they call her name . in the universe buuel concocts in the phantom of liberty , anything goes . the amazing thing about this movie is that , instead of seeming like an irrational series of surrealistic sketches , the phantom of liberty has a broad theme to support its free-form structure : it 's buuel 's comic vision of freedom run amuck . sure , the idea of liberty is appealing to everyone...but , as buuel seems to be suggesting , even freedom has its limits . the opening scene of the movie is set in toledo , spain in 1808 , as napoleon 's troops attempt to liberate the spanish and are greeted with cries of " down with liberty ! " there can be times when we want the assurance of authority , rather than the freedom to act in whatever way we please . buuel does n't take a stand one way or the other , really ; he 's just an artist who is intrigued by the idea , and his interest fuels the free-form structure of the film , and its content . almost anything and everything he can think of- --within the bounds , i suppose , of the same themes he covered throughout his long and illustrious film career- --is thrown into this movie , and while some viewers may perhaps prefer the comfort of a movie with some structure , i found its elegant chaos exhilarating . only a master filmmaker who had absolute confidence in what he was doing would dare make a movie like this . i think buuel pulls it off triumphantly here ; somehow , he makes the movie seem almost logical , the way it progresses . the phantom of liberty is a sheer delight . highly recommended

dvd pos 215.txt having visited st. petersburg , russia a year ago , i could not pass up the chance to watch this movie . i must say , it was nicely done . i can relate to the obnoxious , business like brother...who happily did not go with me on my trip . i was more like the care-free younger brother , but not quite so care-free as the character protrayed . the scenery was awesome...all the fantastic architecture of those magnificent buildings and sculptures were in the movie...although i wish there were more because the city is full of beauty . and this goes for the women as well ! ! i mainly went to see the city...but i also went there as a very confirmed bachlor to meet a lady that i planned would be my travel companion . what i did n't expect was to really fall in love : - ) . the big reason why i confirmed myself to be a life time bacholar was my exposure to american women...as if explained in the additional extras on the dvd...but the russian lady that i met there and the culture of her up-bringing quickly changed my way of thinking ! ! one thing i should add though . the movie gave the impression that you can take her home with you when you go back to the states yourself . such is not the case . it takes paperwork and a lot of patience to get her here...expect at least 8 months , but it is more like a year . it is time consuming to get her a us visa . but she was worth the wait for me and if you want a life long partner and lover , the wait is worthwhile . another word of caution : prepare yourself to fall in love with russia...the people are very nice and i know of a lot of americans who go there quite often to visit and re-visit...some even live there now 
music neg 407.txt just like in my other review i ca n't figure out the madness over these guys . i will ask in this post as well for somebody to actually explain to me why they should be heard and are relevant in a creative way . honestly people you ca n't call these guys artists . an artist creates something from a idea or two these guys take those ideas and just lump them together . it 's as simple as that . and to top it of they do n't have the chops as musicians to be relevant in that form either . a comment like " they rock " or " the lead singer is soooo hot " are n't examples of a great artist or band . from the dates of the last post my words might be in vain , kind of like the validity of this record . because there has n't been a post on here for two years . if a fan of banking benjamins does stumble upon this post i invite you to check out my other reviews , and checkout some relevant and great music 
books pos 46.txt this book , styron 's finest , is about redemption . heralded by the epigraph from john donne , the intricately structured tale with its marlowian manipulations of narrative points of view soon becomes so enthralling that it 's impossible to put down . but it 's also to styron 's great credit that the novel 's theme , redemption through confrontation with death and violence , is reflected through its feverish style . there are not many books in the postwar era , and none in the united states , that have such a non-moralistic but intensely moral character and impact . echoes of the greek tragedians ( several times evoked in the text ) and of dostoyevski abound . finally , the crucial role by the most-fleshed out non-expatriate character , a philosophical italian small-town cop named luigi , elevates the moral drama to a metaphysical dimension that most contemporary writers do n't even seem to understand , let alone approach . it 's a shame that styron has not received the nobel prize yet

dvd neg 59.txt the casting for this production could scarcely be better ( of particular note is the harrowing performance of judi dench ) and it 's one of shakespeare 's best plays . that said , this film of a production on stage does n't quite carry the viewer 's interest for the entire play . there are times when the actors seem downright pretentious ; you feel as if they 're tellings us , " we know how deep this is so appreciate it , please . " that 's too bad since " macbeth " is a work thriving with intense imagination with a few hallucinations thrown in so it should invite a great film . sadly , this relatively slow-moving production is n't it . there are , of course , wonderful moments with mackellan and particularly dench ( no one plays the scene where lady macbeth goes crazy better than dame judi ) . i just do n't know if that alone makes this a worthwhile purchase . for my money , kurosawa 's " throne of blood " is a far better choice .

books pos 852.txt i was assigned this book for a college course and was greatly surprised at its quality . blamires had c.s. lewis as a tutor , and i 've read some of lewis 's writings and have found them to be above average but not particularly special ( many people do find his works special of course ) . blamires , on the other hand , i find to be very unique - his book is top quality and very helpful . i 'm surprised this is n't a very popular book , as it ought to be . i have only two complaints , both of which are purely stylistic . first , the edition i have looks like it 's a copy of an earlier edition , which makes the text hard to read ( i got used to it after a while though ) . some publisher should take it upon themself to retype this book and republish it . my second criticism is something that ca n't be avoided - the book was originally written in the early sixties , so a lot of the examples are dated ( i.e. references to wwii , which was still in memory , also out-of-date terms like " jive " , etc. ) . however , just a few of the examples are affected by this . the book as a whole could be reasonably passed off today as a recent work , since so much blamires 's criticism of the christian mind ( or lack thereof ) still ( sadly ) applies . however , the christian mind today is being rediscovered , and the march of atheism is on the decline , with the march of religion in general on the rise . even though things are looking up , christians should keep blamires 's book in mind - not to get too comfortable with this ( secular ) world , for our real home is beyond bodily death . that we ought to have a supernatural orientation is basically the theme and summary of this book . superb book , and i really recommend this to anyone . this is definitely recommended for christians , and also for any non-christian who are curious and want to take a look at some of the problems christians have today

dvd pos 695.txt i have waited years for this release to be laser scribed onto dvd- -it is here ! a very good movie . i have to say the inspector carson ( belonging to an unknown federal agency ) , character played by kurtwood smith is good if not great acting . he epitomizes the sort of corrupt fellow we all love to hate . his lines in the movie ( particularly when he and border patrol agent bobby logan , kris kristofferson ) discuss ' politics ' during a stakeout are sheer unadulterated cynicism at the nuttiest best . the conspiracy flakes have probably adopted these lines as their mantra... . great bit part acting by rip torn , roberts blossom ( as the desert rat ) , tess harper and the young and sultry jean smart . kris kristofferson does a great job with his lines and acting capacity and treat williams does ok as well . anyone who has been in law enforcement- -or any other supervisory capacity for that matter- -has seen the idiocy and vacuum headedness of the supervisor depicted in the movie of the border patrol : totally inept . the soundtrack by tangerine dream is one of my all time favorites because it fits the movie seamlessly and draws you into the scenes . a must see movie .

dvd pos 753.txt i feel some of the other reviews here are unjust and over exagerated . there were two places in the film that in total lasted maybe about five minutes where the sound was distorted , but not badly since you could still understand the characters clearly ( ex. one area had a warpy vhs noise and the second had a bit of low static ) . the costumes were well selected , but i felt a better job could have been done on the rats and the lizard ( you can see a gap where the costume ends on his face ) . this version follows the book well , though it left out a favorite qoute about the taste of the liquid in the first scene that she drinks from the " drink me " bottle . i also felt that the british accents in the movie enhanced the film . i recomend this to fans and people who are n't overly critical of films

software pos 682.txt i chose office ultimate 2007 as it seemed to not only have everything i could possibly need to run a business , but also easy functionality that would keep me from pulling my hair out because of software or design issues . ultimate 2007 certainly does n't disappoint ! - set up was fairly easy : two disks came with the package . disk one contains most of the software and disk two contains applications that guarantee that you are the owner of the software and have the right to all of the accounting and key business functions . - ribbon technology removes the old " hunt and find " menu method ( although for those of us that took the time to memorize and learn the location of every buttom and drop-down it did take a day or two to get used to the new set up ) . - integration with the web and other programs is virtually seemless . - excel is no longer the chore it once was because of the above mentioned ribbon . - accounting software is included . - ink and crossword . i 'm not one for games on my business pc , but for anyone that likes to doodle or zone out with crosswords , ultimate lives up to its name by including an art program designed for pen users and excellent crosswords . - onenote . i like post-its ( perhaps a little too much *l* ) and always used the post-it note software on my business computer to keep notes . i used onenote 2003 sparingly because i simply found the post-it note software easier to use on my desktop , but...with my tablet pc one note 2007 added a new dimension to my notetaking that i feel will work well with my business : the earlier mentioned web and application integration and handwriting to text functionality . i may still use post-it now and then for quick notes or perhaps the windows " stickys , " but the long note pages , pasting of images and other web info , and pen to paper note taking makes this product invaluable . - word . what can i say ? this is my primary software tool and i use it on a tablet pc . the 2007 applications were made for my computer type . i can easily click on formatting tools with the touch of my wacom pen and i do n't have to stop mid-thought to make a change or wait until i finish the document to then make my edits . - powerpoint , publisher , access , groove , infopath et cetera ( also included ) : i am still delving into these , but they appear to have all of the perks of the other programs . so , did i have any dislikes ? 1. the ink program does n't respond to my wacom pen as well as the windows journal or microsoft onenote . it also does n't have easy to use tools within the software . since it was an " extra " and will not be my primary desktop publishing , design , or art tool - i 'll probably remove it at some point from my tablet . 2. microsoft does not include an instruction manual or reference book with this program . as a result , after installation of the first disk and microsoft 's statement that all of my programs were installed , i could n't find my accounting software , had no idea that the accounting software was on the second disk ( the second disk , when loaded , does n't mention that the software is on the disk until after the software installation is complete and instead mentions other business applications ) , and wasted over an hour trying to find it . also , i 'm a " hands on " person and although i have access to the internet whenever i need it , i enjoy having an actual book in my hands from time-to-time while learning . ultimate is made with enough simplicity that a manual is n't really necessary ( i.e. most questions can be answered by the " help " window ) , but...for the hefty price tag , i do n't think it would have been too much to ask microsoft to include a basic " this is how you install the programs and this is what to expect " booklet . also note : athough microsoft , through their downloads e-mail updates , provided a " getting started " tab with a " how-to " for each major software applications , the tabs had to be added " after the fact " and many of you might find yourselves frustrated with the lack of upfront instructions on how to use the software . beside those few quirks , i fully stand behind my 5 star rating of this product and purchasing this product through amazon ( i.e. amazon 's pricing was less than the big boy retailers or online vendors ) . shipping turnaround with super saver : 2 days . 
dvd neg 765.txt so this was the breakout movie for mira sorvino , the one that earned her an academy award for best supporting actress in 1995. this movie , and mira sorvino 's performance in it , was so bad that after it was over , i just had to find out who her competitors were for the 1995 best supporting actress category . let 's see.....according to wikipedia they were : kathleen quinlin ( " apollo 13 " - a fairly standard worried-wife-of-astronaut-in-danger role ) , mare winningham ( " georgia " - did not see this one ) , joan allen ( " nixon " - did not see , but how hard can it be to play the wooden pat nixon ? ) , and kate winslet ( " sense and sensibilities " - did not see either , but ang lee was robbed by the academy here also ) . it only proves just how few good roles there are for women in today 's hollywood that mira sorvino could win an oscar for this sort of performance . and i was beginning to warm up to her , too - she was great in " romy and michele 's high school reunion " , and terrific also in " beautiful girls " . so , what exactly is so bad about this movie ? here 's a brief list : 1. mira sorvino plays the entire movie in a high-pitched falsetto that sounds like her voice is breaking . another reviewer described this as similar to listening to fingernails on a blackboard . maybe in 1995 , because she was new , the academy did n't realize that this was n't her real voice and took pity on her... . 2. stupid plot device of the greek chorus . 3. stupid happy ending with a twist . 4. lots of profanity and dialogue that includes explicit descriptions of sex acts done in pornography movies.....while this movie is not itself a porn flick , the explicit details of the porn industry included in the dialogue definitely makes it not a movie for families to watch . 5. odd sight of a very old and wrinkly woody allen ( with dyed hair and bald spot ) making out with two women young enough to be his granddaughters.....all right , so i 'm just jealous - woody still looks gross... . 6. cliched , poorly developed characters , a plotline that goes around in circles , and lots and lots of pointless , unfunny dialogue . in summary , this movie is bad , bad , bad..... .

dvd pos 68.txt francis ford coppola 's apocalypse now is a pure example of method filmmaking . it is the true craftmanship of an essential filmmaker . the art direction , editing and sound effects are partially a small fragment which makes this film classical and memorable . what drives the integrity and semblance of the film is the storyline , acting and inner message . the inner message evidently enough is that war is hell , or in other words , hell is war . not many directors have the ambition or the true courage to establish such a well-defined piece of art . european filmmakers would n't have the slightest problem of directing the film or throw in their personal feelings about the war . what is most interesting is that an american filmmaker spoke his style and the style of the film 's collaborators through the continuance of the film . the plot is fairly simple and brief , adapted by joseph conrad 's heart of darkness . martin sheen plays the role of captain willard , a war-torn character who does not see any hope in life or humanity anymore . he has a mission and it is to capture a presumed colonel kurtz ( marlon brando ) who has fabricated an army of existensial soldiers on the outskirts of the cambodian jungle . throughout the film we encounter astonishing sequences . the most unforgettable is the dawn helicopter attacks . robert duvall 's character colonel kilgore is a steady and firm example of the basic american army brain : to search and destroy and then destroy some more if it includes yourself . the children walk about the playground , oblivious to any danger . the helicopters come into view from the dawning sea ; millions of sprinkle reflect from the water , we hear the helicopter 's engines roar from the horizon and soon enough we are stuck in a messy attack . throughout the sequence we hear wagner 's ' ride of the valkyries' . it is method filmmaking . the starting sequence is as fascinating as the rest of the movie ; a beautiful scene of palm trees blowing in the ragged wind and seconds away from being inflamed with a carpet bombing . let 's not forget the scene where the soldiers of the boat in which sheen travels in , stop an innocent upcoming boat , suspecting them to be vietcongs and carrying artilleries . then they spark off a heavy scene of shooting in which all of the passengers of the boat are pulverised to pieces with their crops and food savaged in the atrocity . this film has its famous moment , some better to be kept quiet about until they come through the screen . it does n't require any intellectual understanding , although the film is intellectually remarkable . the american soldiers in the vietnam war jumped into the land of a fresh governmental country , aiming to protect themselves and in the end only received death and chaos for their troops and for the majority of the country they were fighting against . it was a war gone mad , like all other wars , without purpose or dignity . it was a pure act of humanity : to destroy and restore their own greedy needs . this is a film in which there is no saviour , where it is hardly possible to find hope in the gloomiest corners and where all surroundings are plagued with the infatuations of greed , anger , foolishness and egoism . as coppola once said about the film : ' this film is n't about vietnam . this film is vietnam' . he was right to the date . during the current situations of the world , where they are trying to protect their own skin , the world should try to analyse this film as much as possible and wonder about what it is trying to represent . it is a film which does not ask for applause or damnation . it asks for realism . enjoy

software pos 655.txt at home , i 've been a mac user since 1991. i also have been something of a linux fanatic too and have used several distros , mostly red hat and now fedora core . at work , however i have used ms-dos , windows 3.11 , 95 , 98 and xp . it 's fair to say i have never liked microsoft . but on a laptop i use at work ( an older gateway 400vtx with a 2.2ghz intel celeron ) , i just upgraded to vista home basic . i also upgraded the memory to its maximum 1gb . and despite my years of eschewing microsoft , guess what ? i must say i really like the os . it runs fine on my slower system and i had no problems installing and no conflicts with drivers . i think microsoft has really made a " cool " os 
music pos 75.txt 1978 the stage is set for an album to emerge out of the crumbling decay that is the city of cleveland . just like their other fellow ohion 's devo , the guys in pere ubu obviously saw the world in a slightly different way.i have owned this recording in various formats since 1980 and i have never grown tired of this album . i find this album to have an almost timless quality in that even though it was recorded over 25 years ago , if the original band itself tried to go back into the studio and re-record it , it just would'nt happen . there is just a certain magic that they captured in 1978 , as to the music itself i tend to break - up this album into 2 distinct parts . side one being the more accessible " drunken " side with more garage style sounds almost punk rock in its leanings guitar wise , but a little too intelligent , just listen to the lyrics.side 2 is definately the " drug " side like a bad acid trip vocalist david thomas takes you on a journey thru the seedy back streets of cleveland ( i have never heard smashing bottles sound so creepy or atmospheric ) and the rest of the band help to re-inforce this craziness by going off in a million different directions.i could give you a track by track anylisis of this record but suffice to say that music is somethig you should anylize , experience and consume at your own leisure , and then form your own opion of what each of the songs on this album mean to you . so if you loved things like throbbing gristle 's song hamburger lady then u will surely love pere ubu 's album the mordern dance.as another reviewer mentioned before black francis of the pixies fame must have almost certainly listened to these guys.i also hear there influences in recent bands such as portishead and queens of the stone age just to name a few.so if you enjoy bold experimental music that is still as fresh sounding as it was in 1978 then give your ears a chance to have a listen to this album , even if you have to beg , steal or borrow it .

books pos 657.txt ironweed by william j . kennedy was the latest selection for a book club i 've recently joined . the premise of the club is to read a novel and then view the movie ( at the group meeting ) that was based on the novel . as i expected , the movie paled in comparison to the book , despite the screenplay being written by kennedy himself . jack nicholson plays the main character ( francis ) and meryl streep is his " wanna be " socialite girlfriend ( helen ) , but this star power does n't elevate the story beyond what kennedy had already done in the novel . set during the " great depression , " ironweed is a great look at the underbelly of society : drunks , homeless , impoverished , and in that regard the story is timeless . i enjoyed the characters ' quirkiness and the loosely connected plots , but more significantly to me were the themes of redemption , forgiveness , and love . the love aspect may be hard to spot , but it is there , unconventionally , in many of the character 's interactions . this favorable recommendation comes with a warning : it can be a depressing read , definitely not a happy one , and while i found it inspirational , it will not conjure any blithe emotions . ironweed is definitely not a june beach read , being more apropos to a long winter night , indoor , by a warm fire . 
books pos 395.txt in all the talk about education issues these days , it 's easy to forget that what 's really important is the relationship , the energy , between students and teacher . when the teacher closes his door and is face-to-face with thirty kids- -that 's where it 's at . it 's not test scores or textbooks or innovative curriculum- -it 's what happens between people in a classroom . this book shows that dynamic relationship between eager , active kids and a caring , active teacher . it 's not all pleasant , and successes are sometimes small , but a pervasive caring underlies it all . as a teacher , this book reminded me that sometimes the best thing i can do for my kids is to leave all that paperwork , go for a walk , go to bed early so i can be there for them the next day 
music pos 752.txt i am a latecomer to the works of chopin , unqualified to comment on dinu lipatti 's technique and interpretation , but this recording gives an interesting framework to explore the waltzes . they are numbered 1 through 14 in order of opus publication , but on this disc lipatti shuffles them to form a cycle of his own devising . there are four waltzes in the key of a flat and it seems one challenge was to space them across the recital . contrast this to alexandre thaurad 's cd where he clumps like-key waltzes into groups . ( he also adds five more posthumous works . ) most of chopin 's waltzes start on the dominant , meaning either the fifth note of the home key ( the tonic , the i ) , or a dominant seventh chord ( v7 ) which leads to the tonic . lipatti uses this feature to string together his cycle . if , for instance , there were a waltz that ended on a c natural it could easily bring us to waltz no 4 , which starts on an insistent c7 chord before rising to the home key of f major . i will use this as the starting point for tracing the harmonic relationships of the tracks on this cd . track 1 : waltz no 4 in f , " grande valse brillante " - as noted starts on the v7 and finishes on f in octaves . track 2 : no 5 in a flat - begins on a trilling dominant eb , but the note it trills up to is an f ( which ended the previous track ) . finishes with a parting shot , a turn in the bass ending on ab. track 3 : no 6 in d flat , " minute waltz " - starts on ab ; the contour of the opening phrase echoes the gesture of the previous parting shot as well . ends in db. track 4 : no 9 in a flat - has two pick up notes then hits a db on the downbeat of the first measure . the right hand ends on the ab above middle c . track 5 : no 7 in c sharp minor - starts on a g sharp above middle c , which is the same black key ( enharmonic equivalent ) of the previous ab. ends in c# minor . track 6 : no 11 in g flat - starts with a pick-up turn then hits the downbeat with a db ( enharmonic c# ) . ends on a gb in the treble clef . track 7 : no 10 in b minor - starts quietly on the same note , an f# ( enharmonic gb ) . ends with a soft b in the bass clef . track 8 : no 14 in e minor - first note is the exact same b in the bass . ends in e minor . track 9 : no 3 in a minor - starts on an e in the bass melody . ends in a minor ; keep in mind that minor third of this key is a c natural - - you can hear it in the melody of the third to last measure . track 10 : no 8 in a flat - this is a side-stepping change of keys , but there is an harmonic link to the previous waltz . instead of starting on the dominant , this one begins on the major third - - c natural . track 11 : no 12 in f minor - starts on the dominant - - c again . toggle back and forth between tracks 10 and 11 and you will hear that these two waltzes start on the exact same pitch . instead of ending in f minor this waltz closes in the relative major of ab. the last three notes are a rise and fall , bb-c-ab . track 12 : no 13 in d flat - there is a leading note before the dominant . the first three notes ( bb-ab-f ) fall and rise in a mirroring gesture to the final phrase of the previous . ends quietly in db. track 13 : no 1 in e flat , " valse brillante " - another side-stepping key change but there is a connection . if you toggle between tracks 12 and 13 you will hear the same initial note , a bb - - quietly in the former , boldly here . finishes resoundingly in the tonic eb. track 14 : no 2 in a flat , " grande valse brillante " - introduction in the dominant chord , eb7. closes in ab. from here you could loop around to the beginning of the cycle again , linking the major third ( c natural ) to the v7 that starts the f major waltz 
dvd neg 41.txt as part of my ongoing quest to catch up on comic book movies that i have missed over the past few years i came across this clunker . i understand , of course , that i am not the target demographic here . most comic book fans want nothing more out of their movies than authenticity ; unfortunately i was looking for an actual cinematic experience . four scientists go gallivanting around space with some chump named dr. von doom ( who wins the award for the most obvious name for a villain ever ) ; they run into trouble and are the recipients of super powers ( now we 're talking ) thanks to some chemical filled cloud . what follows is one of the most shameless attempts to buy a box office victory in history . special effects pile on top of bad special effects as the film is quickly reduced to nothing more than a dull fireworks show . we get the thing caving in the front of a semi-truck with his shoulder as the money shot , but it comes in the middle of a scene that left me mystified . an entire bridge and just about every car on it are destroyed by these four farting around with their found powers . but since these are the good guys we have to watch as they scramble to save everybody they endangered , and succeed . destruction for the fans , no consequences for the characters . but why would director tim story try anyways ? he knows the people are just showing up to ogle at jessica alba as she pretends to act . so instead of focusing on the story he focuses on making sure that those dozens and dozens of product placements make it into the frame . he should have just directed a pepsi commercial with jessica alba and saved us the trouble of watching this mess . the plot is also outwardly defiant in its interest in being even a little entertaining . instead of watching good fight evil we are stuck watching the superheroes squabble . they are n't even aware that the bad guy is the bad guy until the last fifteen minutes of the movie . they go out , show off their powers ( in things like extreme sports , you know , for the kids ) , and then yell at each other for not being discreet enough . there is also a lackluster love triangle between sue storm ( jessica alba ) , reed richards ( ioan gruffudd ) and dr. von doom ( julian mcmahon ) . i 'm sure it is real nice to believe that someone who looks like jessica alba would rather go out with a lowly scientist as opposed to the all powerful , all wealthy dr. von doom . but chances are if you 're chasing someone that looks like her she 's not interested in your kind demeanor and meaningful career . so why is my rating so high above the zero i 've been talking it up to be ? well it is what it is . it did n't put me to sleep as it washes over you fairly harmlessly and quickly . it was fun watching tv actors such as michael chiklis and julian mcmahon try their luck at a hollywood blockbuster . and at least it was n't " catwoman . " but what it was was insulting . beyond the obvious point that nobody would believe jessica alba as a scientist lies another that shows just how stupid story thinks we are . at a newsstand , on the cover of people magazine there is a picture of sue storm . now if stephen hawkings ca n't make it to the cover of people then what chance does this two-bit scientist have ? **1 / 4 
music neg 738.txt first of all let me clearly state that im from atlanta and i am a diehard fan of lil scrappy and that is why it breaks my heart to tell you that this cd is garbage . besides money in the bank there are no other standout cuts and it is a shame because the underground mixtape he dropped with dj don cannon early last year was on fire , he and cannon delivered all new tracks and there were all on point , that was of course before 50 's influence which brings us to our problem . the influence of curtis jackson a.k.a 50 cent is very clear on this album . i like 50 but he knows little of the way we make records down south . if the g-unit boss would have just stayed out he way and let scrappy pick and choose his own tracks , verses etc. everything may have been fine . the guy is a control freak and as a result nobody in the " a " is pumping this and it is a shame because when scrappy is on point the boy is unstoppable . this cd is garbage plain and simple and 50 's influence is going to put the the crown prince of the south 's career in serious jerpody unless he quickly wise 's up . this is an honest review from a fan that has been down since day one.i have bought all the mixtapes and everything else he 's dropped but , im telling you if you the consumer buy this cd you will regret it and to scrappy ditch the g unit do what 's in your heart and get back to business . 
camera pos 794.txt i shot my second feature ( flying tiger ) on the dvx and took it to the cannes film fest market and no one could tell it was n't film . this camera is fantastic if you shoot right . i suggest this camera over all the other similarly-priced models . we have done extensive testing with many cameras and this is my favorite . the jvc is many thousands more and you get less grain with it in dark areas , true , but for the money , the dvx , if you shoot properly with it , will get you amazing results . for proof , you can check out footage shot in a ton of lighting conditions at my site . we had the best luck in natural light , with simple chimera diffusers . if you 're honest with yourself and do n't plan on hitting the lottery anytime soon ( getting a real distribution deal / full 35mm blowup ) and you need a good looking film for fests or dvd , there is no way you should shoot on film , or another camera . we shot a full feature on no money and had many distrib offers , all because of the look this camera gave us . i 'm planning on using it again for my next film . ! viva la revolucion ! put the dvx in 24p advanced mode and rip the knob off 
books neg 46.txt i was expecting this book to be a great story , but very disappointed . i cannot believe the publisher allowed the author to publish this book as it is . the book is insipid and dull , has no flow , no story , or no plot . let me present an example . i have read many insightful newsweek articles by a writer allan sloan . for example , sloan describes a sprint merger event in this way , " if talk is getting cheaper , why did mci worldcom pay $115 billion to buy sprint ? the once staid phone companies have launched a merger blitzkrieg in an effort to emerge at the center of the wired world . can regulators handle the complex new order.... . " it has a clear logical axis , and has a force to attract readers into it . but jeter describes it like this , " the merger announcement of worldcom and sprint spurred building activity around worldcom headquarters as real estate developers readied for economic prosperity . the real estate inventory swelled with new planned unit.... . " it always presents off-center , trivial detail which makes a reader bored . 70% of books are consumed to described a dry and dull fact , like " the merger of company a & b raised the stock to $x " etc. there is no insight here . but unfortunately , unlike enron scandal , there is no other book that centered on the worldcom scandal . you would get much better comprehension by collecting articles in newsweek or business week , if you have lexisnexis or ebiscohost .

dvd neg 758.txt a french saying goes : " the more things change , the more they stay the same . " it appears that the " historical " epic film of yesteryear is still much like that of today in that " poetic " license is taken to the extreme in passing outright lies and fabrications as truth . one of the things that really turned my stomach watching this is d w griffith 's emphasis at least twice during the film that he did not intend to offend any race but wanted to show historical events and yet goes on to portray outright falsehoods as truth . firstly , we all know that this cameron dude did not start the kkk and that this organisation has its roots in indiana and not south carolina . secondly , the kkk is not the defender of the south and there is no need to " purify " the race as is portrayed here the exact words used by d w is " preserve the aryan race . " modern science , using cutting edge dna research has already proved that we all come from the same african man about 60 , 000 years ago and so any racial distinctions are not only ethically wrong but factually wrong as well . like it or not , we are all related and separated only by about 2000 generations despite our seemingly outward physical differences and have a common ancestor . some of the portrayals of blacks as alcoholics and white women predators with behaviours more akin to monkeys i found extremely revolting and shocking and leaves me completely unsurprised that riots and lynchings quickly followed the screenings of this movie . yes , this movie may have been the first feature length movie that used a number of novel techniques but does this excuse the content ? this is not akin to an einstein discovering relativity folks ; every single " good " thing about this movie would have been " discovered / invented " with or without d w . eventually and very probably very soon after . every one of the techniques used would have eventually been used by any of the later , talented directors of the time . the overall lies , attempts to justify racism and the murderous kkk more than make this film fit for the dust bin than for immortality in movie 's great hall of fame . they say that racists are not born but bred ; this is why i 'm not at all surprised at what d w griffith has done here . his father was considered a " hero " of the confederate army where he served as a colonel . i 'm sure as a bitter loser of the great war , he must have taught his son his belief system and how to be a great racist . this movie has not been preserved all that well with many scenes being either too bright or too dark and the soundtrack is too loud and it 's quite irritating to have to keep hearing mendelssohn 's overtures over and over again . in conclusion , the question this movie raises is does freedom of expression mean it 's okay to make a mockery of history to further a racist directors ' world view ? also , do you buy the fact that just because this is the first movie that 's longer than an hour mean that this should be revered for all time despite its extremely offensive and destructive message ? like i said before none of the " techniques " that this film claims to have " discovered " are earth-shattering discoveries that would have required a genius to uncover anyway . so the bottom line is we have here an extremely racist and hate-inducing film that caused a lot more damage than good ; d w griffith 's legacy / mess

dvd neg 587.txt that 's all i could think of when my family and i sat down to watch this movie together . we had told the story to our children about the miraculous staircase built without nails in a small chapel in santa fe . the story itself is so powerful and moving . built in the 1870s , the chapel was nearly complete when it became apparent the choir loft stairs would not fit . the sisters ' prayed a novena to st. joseph and on the ninth day their prayers were answered when a mysterious carpenter arrived , built the " miraculous " staircase , and then disappeared without being paid . the staircase is a double helix with no visible support . it 's 23 feet tall and makes two 360 degree spirals , and the wood used is not a known wood in any area near santa fee ! this movie however is about a mother superior who has faith but harbors real resentment towards indians and also likes to curse ( how this has anything to do with the actual story i still have no idea ! ) . at one point when a nun is " shocked " to hear mother curse mother surperior responds " oh margret get off the cross and get down here with the rest of us " . when the mysterious carpenter shows up and starts to build the staircase , the architect and the contractor decide that this is a bad thing and threaten to kill the carpenter . meanwhile this carpenter who is sent by " god " builds the staircase with wood that does n't work , is arrested after being falsly accused of attempted murder , and leaves everyone to believe vandalls destroyed the staircase when in fact he originally destroyed it before rebuilding it better . in the end the staircase is built and this mother superior ( who is on death 's door ) is so moved that she literally crawls up the staircase in a very " weird " / " uncomfortable " scene until she reaches the choir loft and dies . wow , inspiring . the best thing i could think of is this director and writer took a wonderful and moving story and turned it into a hollywood flop . this was obviously written , directed , and produced by people who have no idea how the staircase was built but are pretty darn sure it was n't a miracle because hey , miracles just do n't happen . the acting was pretty good but the story was junk . unfortunately i bought this movie . if you are looking for a true inspirational movie that you can watch with your family , rent or buy mother theresa with olivia hussey . hands down the best saints movie every filmed . half way through the movie my 5 year old says out loud " wow , she really cares about everybody ! " inspirational movie , compared to this disappointment 
dvd pos 513.txt truth be told , i should probably give this film only four stars because it does take a while to really get going and i think some of the story elements could have been presented more effectively . when this thing gets going , though , the descent easily attains not-to-be-missed status , and on top of all the incredible special effects , oppressive atmosphere , and grievous bloodletting ( made with a pretty limited budget , by the way ) , one of the most important plot points of the story is actually brought home in an impressively subtle manner . are you kidding me ? blood , gore , a claustrophobic atmosphere like you would n't believe - and subtlety ? how could i not give the descent five stars ? so you 've got these young british women who like to get together once a year and engage in some sort of risky , extreme activity . white water rafting , for example . everyone has fun , but then a horrible automobile accident changes the life of one of the women , sarah ( shauna macdonald ) , forever . still recovering from her terrible loss , sarah joins her friend beth ( alex reid ) in america , where mutual friend juno ( natalie mendoza ) , an alpha female if there ever was one , has staked out a cave system just begging to be explored . joining in the fun are holly ( nora-jane noone ) , juno 's new gung-ho sidekick , and a couple of sisters who round out the spelunking sextet . the movie drags a good bit as we sit and watch the girls arrive at their destination in the appalachians ( apparently somewhere in the north carolina mountains - although the movie was filmed entirely in the uk ) , then do their bonding thing the night before the big adventure . once they descend into the cave system , though , things start getting more intense fairly quickly . their first real move down into the complex of cave structures turns into quite a tight and claustrophobic ordeal , especially for sarah who gets stuck and is barely pulled to safety before the tunnel collapses . that 's when juno , a woman with more than her fair share of secrets , admits that she has led the girls into a cave system that has never been explored before , supposedly to help reunite the group . well , it does just the opposite , but they just have to keep going . if there is a way out , they 're going to have to find it the hard way . things are already creepy enough at this point . the filmmakers did an incredible job with the sets , making the viewer feel as if he / she is trapped in a real cave system with the characters . just watching these girls pull their bodies through extremely tight , dark spaces was enough to get me feeling pretty darn claustrophobic . but the real fun was just about to begin . in the wake of one of the most realistic compound leg fracture scenes you 'll ever want to squirm through , sarah spots the presence of someone or something else down there with them . no one believes her - at first . when the " crawlers " attack , though , all hell breaks loose two miles under ground . these gollum-like creatures are some kind of blind , albino humanoids who hunt by sound , can scamper and climb like monkeys , move unbelievably quickly , and really tear into whatever flesh they can find . not only are they frighteningly impressive in and of themselves , the filmmakers present them in the most effective of cinematic light . and when the girls fight back , it 's cinematic magic as the filmmakers hold nothing back in the creepy , bloody , gruesome department . and even as characters are fighting for their lives , a personal bombshell or two also drops to ratchet up the frenetic drama level even higher . the ending is a little controversial because american theatrical audiences did n't get to see the true final scene of the film , for some pretty questionable reasons . a few seconds can and do make a pretty big difference . do n't worry , though , as the dvd has both endings available . the descent draws deeply from the well of man 's most instinctual fears , making it one of the most atmospheric , heart-pounding movies to come along in quite a while . the subtlety of the story in terms of the relationship between sarah and juno is almost as impressive as the cinematography and sound work - and it even leaves room for an alternate explanation of everything that happens here . the descent has everything you could ever ask for in a horror film - and plenty more on top of that . if you care the first thing about horror , you must see this atmospheric tour de force

books pos 323.txt addressing as it does issues of cognition , language usage and acquisition , evolutionary biology and innate versus learned behavior , this work is relevant to many of the great intellectual debates of our time . it is very readable for the most part , although if some of the topics are new to you then you will find a few sections rather heavy going . more illustrations would have helped here . there are syntax structure diagrams and one very grudging , cursory sketch of the language centers of the brain , but many sections cry out for a diagram among all the verbiage . pinker 's lively , humorous style is often commented on but i sometimes found it wearing . he will illustrate a point with an amusing newspaper cutting , then list a few more , then add " i could not resist some more.. . " and so on . i sometimes wished he would just get on with it . a major problem with his nativist approach , which other reviewers have commented on , is that many examples he lists of usages that english speakers would never employ are nothing of the kind . most of them are conceivable and since the first publication of this book , linguists have been busy recording them in the field . the thesis also becomes somewhat unraveled in the penultimate chapter , where he argues that ' you and i ' and ' you and me ' are equally correct in all circumstances , because ' the pronoun is free to have any case it wants' . but if this is so then what has become of the innate awareness of correct usage that the whole theory is about ? if ' between you and i ' sounds instinctively wrong to me and ' between you and me ' sounds instinctively wrong to someone else , does that mean one of us has a mutant grammar gene ? i doubt it . the title itself is problematic . ' instinct ' is not a word much in favor among biologists nowadays and whatever language is , it is certainly not instinctive in the traditional sense . early in the book , pinker admits as much , but determines to use the word anyway , a use that owes more to marketing than to science . still , this is probably the best introductory linguistics text currently available . if you are new to linguistics , start here rather than with chomsky , but please go on to read geoffrey sampson 's work , perhaps starting with his website , to get an alternative view . as with most academic disputes , the answer no doubt lies somewhere in the middle . since chomsky 's early work , the nativists have toned down their claims considerably , while their opponents have made concessions . on page 34 of this book , pinker says , " no one has yet located a language organ or a grammar gene , but the search is on . " more than a decade later , the search is still on . good luck with that .

health neg 78.txt although i have used many electronic cuff devices in the past , this is one of the worst at providing accurate readings . firstly , the cuff is not adequate for very small or larger wrists and the readings are often lower than what you would get if the blood pressure were taken manually the traditional way . in a clinical setting , it is important that you get adequate readings so that the patient can receive the proper treatment based on their readings . it is imperative since you may or may not give medication depending on what you recive via the blood pressure measurement . i have taken a blood pressure manually after getting what i considered a questionable reading only to discover that the wrist blood pressure was far too low and more aggressive measures had to be taken because of the data that was retrieved the old fashioned way . imagine had i taken the initial reading as truth and the patient may have had a stroke as a result . as a rule , i never recommend using these devices for at home use because of the risk of false readings . many people who suffer from hypertension feel that this is a good way of monitoring their blood pressure when in actuality it is giving them a false sense of security . if you are considering buying this product for at home use or for use in a clinical setting , please ask your doctor or nurse for their opinions .

health pos 362.txt my bedroom receives an inordinate amount of morning light and , being a light sleeper , i 've tried numerous ways to protect my slumber . it does n't help that my husband ( god love him ) snores as loud as a small jet plane . i 've tried silicone ear plugs and satin eye masks only to find that the plugs make me feel like i have a head cold and the masks leave unwanted gaps that let in the light . i received the tranquility zone eye mask for a birthday present and i could hardly wait to try it . i love this thing ! it 's thick and large enough to block out all of the light and , due to the design , the mask is positioned perfectly over my ears . the sounds are pleasant ( i 'm a big fan of the " babbling brook " track ) and i love being able to plug my mp3 player in so i can listen to my own nature-sounds tracks , too . i 've given this 5 stars because there 's no option for 4.5. in all honesty , there are a few drawbacks . first , when i say this is thick i 'm not kidding . without my a / c in the summer it might get a bit warm . second , the sound clips themselves are on very short loops.. . so if you have a brain like mine that tunes in to what you 're hearing you 'll notice that the clip repeats itself every 5 seconds or so . were it not for this i 'd be a bigger fan of the first track - - the one that sounds like you 're in a forest - - but i get distracted ( and awakened ) by hearing that bird sound that comes closer then fades . even with these things in mind , i have to say i have n't slept this well in years . i love this thing , and i wish i 'd found it earlier . in fact , i love it so much i 've given it as a gift to two friends who 'd tried on my mask while they were visiting and fell in love with it , too

music pos 972.txt this collection of italian cello sonatas by the great janos starker is one of the most delightful chamber albums i own . the world renowned cellist was joined on this 1966 recording by pianist stephen swedish on five of the selections , and by his frequent collaborator gyorgy sebok on the bach sonata in g minor , which was recorded in 1963 and added to this collection to increase its length ( it is a welcome addition musically too ) . the selections here range from famous composers like bach , boccherini and vivaldi , to the lesser known corelli , locatelli and valentini . for me , the common thread of this recording is the passionate performances of starker . whether it is the happy bounce of the vivaldi allegro , the sublime rendering of the boccherini adagio , or the precise interplay with sebok on the bach sonata , starker plays masterfully and his cello is captured in rich , full sound by the mercury living presence recording technique . this is an excellent purchase for all cello enthusiasts

books neg 508.txt i 'm a wiccan who formally practices within a traditional gardnerian coven , but practices eclectically within my private practice . i read this book because i had heard that it was recommended to my local library by a christian ; purportedly , wicca 's charm was written by an impartial writer . immediately , you realize that this is n't true . catherine sanders has a clearly stated agenda : that wiccans are simply misguided and misunderstand that what they long for is offered by christianity . i could write a long review debating the merits of sanders ' arguments . instead , i suggest that you consider this if deciding whether to read this book which sanders claims to have thoroughly researched . she relies on the writings of margot adler , carol christ , starhawk and phyllis curott ( with barely a nod to scott cunningham and ronald hutton ) to draw many of her conclusions . yet , missing from her notes are such writers as the farrars , merlin stone , raymond buckland , isaac bonewits , patricia crowley , and the matthews , to name just a few outstanding contributors to neopaganism 's base of knowledge . too often , sanders relies on the statements of young wiccans she interviewed who come across as silly and naive . in another case , she bases her thesis that women 's spirituality ( e.g. , goddess worship ) is misguided and that christianity fits the same spiritual needs that women are seeking via one speech that she heard margot adler give shortly after 9 / 11. sanders requests both christians and neopagans to read her book with an open mind . a fair request . but as you 're reading , closely check out her endnotes and analyze for yourself if this book was truly researched with objectivity in mind , or whether sanders limited herself to sources that would support her belief that christianity has everything that a wiccan desires . one needs to go no further than to consider that as sanders attempts to persuade the reader that christianity has always embraced the value of women that not once does she analyze the epistles of paul .

dvd neg 400.txt i had high hopes for this series when i started watching it , though i guess the nonstop obscenities should have been the tip off that under all of that visual masterwork and spiritually stunning characterizations there lurked an twisted message that wasted ten hours of my life to discover . shandala is truly a wonderful character , pure and good , and the characterization of her is very tender , so by episode 21 or so the storyline actually looked like it could end hopeful and uplifting . oh , how wrong of me to think so , because for all of the philosophical and religious trappings , the message of " hope " the marketers promise is that the characters learn in the end that the villain 's demented plan to save the world is really more effective than their spiritualities and that the " truth " is that the emotional and physical torture and destruction of an innocent , good woman is the only way to save the world ! spare me . and if you think that i am disgusted by this message , just imagine what the muslims will think when they see what becomes of all of that quoting of the koran and the muslim character 's final opinions . although the story is technically good , i 'm only giving it one star for the message of despair .

considerable critical acclaim , she should be correcting and grading ( failing ) garbage like this not producing it . so what went wrong ? how did this novel end up so awful ? the answer is brick by brick and piece by piece . there is no one great thing wrong with it but rather a lot of little things . length : if " brevity is the soul of wit " , this novel 's witlessness is easily explained . at 666 pages ( interesting number that ) this novel is about three times as long as it should have been . it would seem that , to some extent like melville before her , naslund confused length with importance , but melville was a lot more skilled at padding than she is . imho this desire to fill too many pages made many of the other problems worse by allowing naslund both to go into unnecessary detail about things no one else cares about and to repeat herself to the point of self-parody . somewhere under the barnacle encrustations may be the finely lined hull of a short novel , but this was a manuscript desperately in need of editing.. . with a meat axe or a chainsaw . the name dropping : one of the pleasures of any historical novel is the encounters between fictional characters and historical figures , but if badly handled these encounters can un-suspend disbelief and downright offend . they are badly handled here . an almost uneducated hick from the backwoods of kentucky encounters by chance a significant number of the thoughtful elites of mid-nineteenth century new england and those she does n't utterly charm with her brilliance and erudition she gets the better of as in her unintentionally hilarious encounter with naslund 's peculiar imagining of nathaniel hawthorne . one or two of these , developed at greater length could have added to the verisimilitude . as it is , it is a zelig or a forrest gump without the humor ( or the self-awareness ) . the politics : even the most conservative readers would probably find the popular views of a majority of mid-nineteenth century new englanders a bit disconcerting if espoused straight in a modern novel , so a certain amount of modernizing would be appropriate just to reduce the cringing . however , naslund takes this to the opposite extreme by having una espouse the politically correct view on every single controversy of the day ( and some that only exist in our significantly sillier day ) from slavery to whaling , from feminism to free love , from homosexuality to sensitivity towards the differently abled , all without consequence or even criticism . this latter is the most offputting because to have actually championed such views back then would have taken considerable courage whatever one thinks of the ideas themselves . una espouses them with all the negative consequences that naslund receives for espousing them today , which is to say : none . the anti-christian bigotry : there is nothing so very wrong with characters in a mid-nineteenth century novel exhibiting agnosticism or atheism as both views were gaining more and more credence at the time , but it is downright silly to suggest that such views would have been widely accepted . it is even sillier to portray christianity as something confined exclusively to the foolish , the bigoted , the future apostate , or the mentally ill . it tells us more about the author than anything else that una is openminded towards every religious and quasi-religious idea of the time except christianity . the farfetched scenarios : i sensed the novel was in trouble during the opening scene in which una loses both her mother and her baby but manages to withstand this blow by making friends with a runaway slave with whom she has a quasi-lesbian encounter... . after this the novel goes into flashback and becomes unrealistic . after her crazy christian father threatens to kill her ( a sentiment the reader will come to know and understand ) , una is raised in a lighthouse by her ludicrously liberal-minded aunt and uncle , encounters two young men who both fall in love with her , disguises herself as a cabin boy and sails on the same whaler with them , successfully avoids detection , is sunk by a whale , survives by committing cannibalism , marries the surviving young man after he goes insane , and is abandoned by him after he goes to live with the indians , leaving her free to " marry " captain ahab ( una never really " marries " anybody but of course nobody ever criticizes ) . things do n't get more realistic in the second half , which includes una 's clever and successful investment in the crazy newfangled idea of obtaining oil from the ground instead of from a whale . riiiight . the mary sue : however , the absolute worst thing about this novel is the fact that it is a " mary sue " that peculiarity of fan fiction in which a laughably idealized and practically perfect in every way alter ego of the author fulfills some basic psychological need while inducing a combination of anger and nausea in the reader . a more realistic main character might have saved it . una never learns anything from her life 's too-many-to-be-believed experiences because she already knows everything . she does n't change because she is already perfect . she does n't have to deal with the criticism of others because she does n't receive any , and she does n't have to beg the forgiveness of those she has wronged because they forgive her so easily and besides , una had her reasons ( and they were very good ones you can be sure ) . the only thing i can figure is that her publisher approved this book on concept alone without anyone ever reading it . i feel like i 've just waded through the inept scribbling of a delusional teenage girl who insists on rereading moby dick in her bedroom.. . with the door locked . 
music neg 628.txt imagine buying this cd after seeing " the mirror has two faces " fully expecting the soundtrack music to the movie , and reading overall great reviews on amazon . imagine the shock of receiving the cd and the surprise of hearing 20 brief cuts of plain instrumental music out of the 24 cuts - the remaining 4 cuts contained very short lines of verse . perhaps barbara , with her tremendous unlimited wealth , felt she would be giving away a " free album " to the masses if the soundtrack contained the vocals in the film . shameless misrepresentation 
health neg 557.txt the reviewer who compared the massage feature to that of a cell phone perhaps said it best , so suffice it to say that one can essentially ignore that aspect of the unit [i might even liken the vibrations to those of an injured ( and no longer airborne ) housefly buzzing in circles]. with respect to the heat ( ing ) , it does perform better , but is by no means stellar . the pro 's are its design for moisture , a better-than-average fabric / material - which holds its shape fairly well and the auto shut-off . the con 's include , as others have said , a huge ac-dc plug / power pack , no apparent ability to wash the darn thing , only modest heat , annoying velcro straps , a two-part power cord that not only must be taped to keep together , but ca n't be removed from the main pad for washing and , perhaps most significantly , the fact that mine died after approx . 18 months ( which , incidentally , raises yet another detractor ; the warranty is only a year , much less than many other brands )

music neg 468.txt yes yes we all know the mega hit when i see you smile . but it would be unfair to put this album into the one hit wonder basket and instead review it as a whole . the band hits gear pretty early with best of what i got but after that it 's pretty bad . how possession ever became a hit i 've not idea . well , where i come from it did n't , but in the us this mob had a string of soppy power ballad hits . the production is good but the fire goes out for most of the album . neil schon is a great guitarist but it was the late 80 's and the guy obviously knew what he had to do for a decent paycheck . besides , he probably wanted some revenge on steve perry so he really wanted to make some cash . pity , listen to some of the guitar licks here and there is a decent hard rock album in the man . rockin ' horse for example . an interesting additin to the aor landscape , and some of the music is lively . but when the whole thing has as much heft as a lettuce leaf it just does n't get my vote . even my devoted aor fan girlfriend of the time only liked the one track ( we all know which one ) . but hey , if aor is your bag you could do a lot worse

dvd neg 260.txt i saw this movie and was shocked at the contents , considering that it was aimed at children . it starts out with the gypsy esmeralda doing a very provocative stripper style pole dance . while no stripping happened , there was n't much other difference in the style of dance . later in the movie , one of the men is obsessing over her in a manner i would never want my children to see . he sings a song about how she will burn in hell if he does n't have her , and meanwhile a vision of her provocative dancing is playing out in the flames of a fire . regardless of the rest of the movie , these two scenes make this highly innapropriate for children . not to mention that the story is very untrue to the novel , which had a tragic ending rather than a happy ever after one .

" soul trains a comin " ( although not a chart hit ) was missing . i would perfer the original version than the 12 inch version used for soul train from seasons 13 - " maria " ( a lackluster lp track from his latest lp , surrender ) should have been replaced with the beautiful " together always " ( from his proper sophmore lp , you & i ) . the horrible and silly " drivin ' force " ( also from surrender ) should have been out ! " lovelite " , " you & i " and " i 'm freaky " lp versions should have been on there instead of the 45 versions because they stood out very well ! ! " is this for real , " right from the start , " and " love has found its way . " were the other great ballads and jams that were non-singles but were gems as well . the absense of " soul trains a comin ' ( original ) " , " together always " , and full versions of " you & i " , " i 'm freaky " , and " lovelite " really knocked off 3 points from best of o'bryan cd and should be made into a redo ! ! for those that wasted thier money on this , " go on and cry " because right stuff records done ripped y'all off ! ! this underated talented artist ( good singer , writer , producer , and instrumentalist ) was trying to be the next prince and michael jackson but he was considered more like a 1980s version of carl thomas ( too soulful for the mainstream ) . people must have bought this cd ( if do not have original lps no more ) because more than half of the tracks are not available on other cds . i admit i love all the songs from the cd ( except for maria and driving force ) , but i will create a new cd under my productions , soul train alumni series along with my own compilations of shalamar , jermaine stewart , pebbles , jody watley and other soul train almumnis . 1. soul trains a comin ' ( original although i love the remix ; loved the keyboard fanfare on the intro ) 2. the gigolo 3. still waters 4. right from the start ( great track and catchy hooks ! ! ) 5. i 'm freaky ( full lp verison , the keyboard solo was missing from the 45 single 4 minute version ) 6. you & i ( full original lp version . loved the closing ) 7. together always ( o showed his true feelings on this 1983 track ) 8. lovelite ( full original lp version - lovelite baby ! ! ) 9. breakin ' together ( good effort and loved the video ! ! ) 10. go on & cry ( good ballad ) 11. lady i love you ( what ever happened to lovin ' your woman and tellin ' her how you feel . this was his best ballad ever and this should school young catz like bobby valentino and r kelly on real love . ) 12. you 're always on my mind ( i 'm glad they included this lp track from 1984 's be my lover on the compilation and would be good for the redo . beautiful ballad that shows a woman on how you feel although she 's seeing someone else ) . 13. tenderoni ( 45 single , i never actually heard of the full lp track before but it was a good pre-new jack single ) 14. is this for real ( great ! ! ! ) 15. you have got to come to me ( beautiful new jack ballad that should have made the charts ) this here is the real best of o'bryan plus more . wish i can add more like " i 'm in love again " , " doin ' alright " , " surrender " " love had found its way " and " shake " but had to pick the best 16 that would fit ! ! - - thank you ! !

camera pos 758.txt shooting with a dslr is great in a lot of ways , but the sensor crop kills my wide-angle capability , which , to me , is absolutely awful ! personally , i hate zoom lenses . i 've got a full set of nikon primes . and while i 'd prefer a prime lens , these zoom lenses are the only game in town for wide angle on crop sensor dslr . i like this lens because it goes wide on digital . i suggest you buy this lens for the 10mm and keep it at 10mm because the 10mm wide end is really where it 's at and the reason to buy this lens over the alternatives . for anybody considering 10mm vs 12mm at the wide end , unless you mostly use the narrower end of the focal length most of the time , 2mm is a significant difference in field of view on short lenses . as the focal length increases ( eg , from 400mm to 600mm ) , the difference in angle of view is not very large . but the difference between 10mm is 12mm even though " only 2mm " is no laughing matter , and if you do n't believe me , you can do a comparison in a camera shop to prove it to yourself . if you end up deciding to get a 12mm , you want to buy the sigma 12mm ( i think it is 12-24mm ? ) because that lens covers full 35mm frame ( and the angle of view has got to be absolutely amazing ) ! also , if sigma or nikon reads this review , please make an 8mm or 9mm f2.8 rectilinear crop sensor prime ! and if sigma reads this review , i want some f1.2 or f1.0 afd primes ! 50mm for film maybe even a digital sensor version in some medium range focal length ! i would definitely buy ( full frame coverage of course ) a mid length and a medium wide angle and a short tele ! neither nikon nor canon makes anything like that ( well , canon kind of does / did ) , so you 'd have the market segment dominated 
music neg 991.txt to much guitar , drowns out all the other instruments . survivor was made famous by heavy keyboards and drums , not guitars . i was expecting another burning heart , is this love , high on you . no songs on this albums have that sound . the vocals by jamison are top notch , but none of the songs sound like the survivor i remember . survivor guitars were only there to complement the keyboards , bass and drums , not drive the whole song . i guess jim peterik was the man behind survivor all along . i give the cd 2 stars for fire makes steel , the rest are throw aways . ***recommended for die hards only*** i highly recommend ' when seconds count ' for anyone getting started with survivor 
dvd pos 221.txt i lived through the vietnam era . if you did you ca n't ever forget . this guy was right in the middle of the crucial decisions that brought the debacle down on us . here he sifts through the sands of his memory and tries to synthesize how it went wrong , why it went wrong and what we can learn to keep from repeating it . for me , here was the most unforgettable moment . decades later he returns to vietnam and winds up sitting at a formal dinner next to his north vietnamese counterpart from those days . macnamara tells him we- -the americans- -were not a colonial power seeking to impose our will but were fighting to stop the spread of communism , seeing north vietnam as a tentacle of communist china . the north vietnamese official gaped at him and then began pounding the table and said , " mr. macnamara , you must have never read a history book ! we 've been fighting the chinese for a thousand years ! we are n't their puppet ! we were fighting for our national freedom ! we would have fought to the last man ! " macnamara says they almost came to blows . here 's the point . macnamara says , as compared to say the soviets , we did n't understand the north vietnamese . we did n't really know enought about them . we had no idea what was in their minds . and that was why we wound up fighting the wrong war against the wrong country and for the wrong reasons ! that 's why we lost ! does any of this sound familiar ? ? ? ? ? ? this is a fantastically good piece of work that ought to be required viewing for every american of voting age . it 's that good and that informative . of course , it wo n't be widely viewed by the american public . we 'll go our goofy way coveting our big-screen tvs and gas guzzling cars and spending our time on important things- -like sporting events

camera pos 124.txt i started with a d50 and have loved it from the very begining . i felt ready to step up to the next level , but did n't think i was ready for the d200. when i heard about the d80 , i read everything i could . the biggest selling point was the fact that it was the same internal workings as the d200 in the more consumer friendly d50 body . i do n't use all of the mode setting and find myself in shutter and aperture priority most of the time , but it 's nice to have the others there when i do n't want to think about or have time to fiddle with settings . the in camera image enhancements are amazing- -but a word of caution . vivid +2 will definitely give you vivid shots- -if not too much so . i 've had this baby for about 2 weeks and imagine it will be my camera for the next couple years . compared to the canon 30d ( which i was thinking about ) or even the new 400d ( i have n't actually held one yet ) , this is the nikon to have . on batter life , i had a recent shoot where i took over 800 shots in a 3 hour period . the battery was at about half and that 's with quite a bit of lcd viewing . at this level both canon and nikon offer great equipment- -you ca n't go wrong with either . just get one of each in your hands , snap a few shots , and go with the one that feels the best for you 
music pos 625.txt quite different from his later big-band recordings . some of the songs that you may find on wes ' ' best of ' collections sound too much like elevator music . not so with this debut album . a drummer , a organist , and a guitar player ; no horn section . stripped down in the sence of band size but very deep and articulate playing . he shows of his trade mark octave playing , his chord solos ( played over the organs rythm chords none the less ) , and flashy runs across the fret board when needed . a good cd to start with for the guitarist who wants to play jazz . 
camera pos 136.txt i just bought a digital rebel about a month ago . love the camera , my old 380ex speedlight integrates with the camera but just does n't offer enough cycle speed to keep up with continuous mode on the rebel . this flash does the job for the rebel and the plug for the external battery pack promises even better performance once i grab that item . another big selling point that really makes this unit worth the cash , is that it has its own infrared focus assist lamp which the digital rebel lacks . when this flash is mounted on your digital rebel , you do n't get that annoying set of quick flashes that the camera has to set off to focus in low light when using the built-in flash . the rebel body uses the infrared focus assist on the 550ex to focus the lens ; this feature alone is worth the big bucks this baby costs . the flash has tons of features that most of us might never use , but as a advanced amateur i 'm glad they 're there so i can play with that if i should choose to try out some fancy stuff . the wireless slave capability is handy but you 've got to have at least one more 420ex , 550ex or 580ex to use that . i like the digital readout on the back of the flash and also the two way bounce head , it 's important to note that you have to press a button to make the head turn either side to side or up / down- --this should make the head sturdier than i 've seen on some units that get loose after awhile and drive you nuts . this unit is a honker- -really big , and , no lightweight either . get yourself a big deep camera bag if you want to lug this thing around with you . what 's the difference between this and the 580ex ? the 580 has very slightly faster cycle times and offers some fancy new automatic flash exposure bracketing modes , for me anyway it was n't worth almost two hundred dollars more for the 580. all of the newer eos camera bodies are fully supported by this unit , it also works on older eos bodies but there are functions available on the newer ones that are n't there on older stuff . i like this flash it covers well , cycles fast and the controls are fairly intuitive and easy to use . when you get yours do n't lose that book , canon does n't seem to have them online anywhere i can find and i 've seen places that want to charge you 18 bucks for a new one 
books neg 25.txt this is an overwritten and overhyped piece of fiction that will never pass for great literature . it is timely but it is not timeless . not one character comes alive even though they all talk endlessly . not one scene is memorable . the true nature of the book - - soap opera- - is cloaked under its many pages . messud is a good writer who in this instance could not tell a good story , and she seems to have believed her publicity machine . i ca n't believe that her husband , who a great literary critic , would not talk her out of publishing this . oh. i forgot . money and fame trumps quality every time .

software neg 349.txt when i first received the product and installed it i had a few configuration issues ( not unusual ) but now , after 8 months of service , they are telling me i need to purchase an upgrade ( $69.99 ) or i will have no virus protection . i contacted customer service ( what a misnomer ) as no one was available to actually speak to me and the automated system was like one of those automated phone loops you enter when trying to contact any company . i finally gave up and an now shopping for a newer and more reliable antivirus and protection system . i did not get a full year of service , got jerked around and have lost all faith in this software package . i wish any other users good luck 
camera pos 72.txt this is a great lens for any user , professional or amateur . this lens offers incredibly wide focal lengths all while giving very impressive / clean results . a slight distortion is noticeable when shooting at 10mm ( 16mm cropped ) but this is easily correctable with software . in addition , the very fast and absolutely silent usm is a huge plus . i highly recommend this lens to anyone wanting great landscapes or great in door / architecture shots ( especially realtors ) 
software neg 597.txt i 've used paperport for years mostly because it was the best of a bunch of poor options . however , version 11 is buggier than earlier versions : every time i launch a microsoft office product , the paperport installer starts up . there is no reference to this in the paperport help file or in the ridiculously inadequate knowledgebase on the paperport site . another bug imprints a " trial copy " legend on your pdf files . this one is explained in the knowledgebase , but requires you to tinker with the registry to correct it . that 's a bit ridiculous . why are they distributing code with a known bug ? nuance expects you to pay $9.95 for e-mail technical support - even if it 's a bug in their own product . the product is a modest performer at best , but nuance 's awful technical support policies are the real sinker here . i 've requested an rma for a refund . jerr

books neg 727.txt as a dad , i was really looking forward to a book on potty training to help me with my 2-year old . this book is lousy though . why ? 1. stupid writing . i got pretty sick of constantly reading all the sappy , " witty " remarks . " dancing the potty mambo " ? give me a break ! 2. stupid advice . this book keeps telling you to talk to your kid like he / she is an adult . i 'm sorry , but a 2-year-old just cannot comprehend a long drawn-out explanation of why you want them or do n't want them to do something . how about just saying , " do n't do that ! " or " hey , you want to try this ? " that seems to work just fine for me . why give your kid a doctoral dissertation every time you want them to do something ? what 's wrong with just telling your kid what to do ( nicely ) , and expecting them to be obedient ? 3. repeating content . this book kept repeating itself over and over . okay , i got it already ! i strongly feel that the author wanted to push this book over the 200-page mark when all that needed to be said could probably have been accomplished in about 50 pages ( or less ) . 4. too many references . this book constantly refers to other chapters . i once counted 6 different references to other chapters on one page . i am not kidding ! huh ? is potty training really that freakin ' complicated ? all i want is some general ideas on how to go about it , how to get started , and a few good tips . i do n't need all these detailed references . ( nor do i need the phrase " potty mambo " repeated to me ad infinitum . ) here is all i wanted to know : -how do i get started ? -what do i do ? -how often do i need to try it ? -should i go for pullups or just keep him in diapers for the moment ? maybe this book got to all of that , but i quit after page 60. i just could n't take it anymore . after hearing the phrases " stay positive " and " potty mambo " repeated to me for the umpteenth time , i had to quit . i returned this book and got my money back . if i were to say anything good about this book , i would say that it has a few good tips , surrounded by about 180 pages of filler . potty training still looms ahead . will i be successful ? probably . but to this book i say , no thanks 
software pos 886.txt coreldraw was my first foray into vector graphics back when version 3 showed up on my desk at the small " mom and pop " screenprinting shop i worked at . back then , corel came with oodles of free fonts , clipart , manuals ... not to mention free technical support via a toll-free number . i stayed with corel exclusively until version 10 ... enduring countless patches , bugs and the dreaded " odd-numbered " curse ( if you tried version 5 or 7 , you feel my pain ) . adobe photoshop was always my photo-editing program of choice ... corelphotopaint just never quite " did it " for me . industry demands eventually delegated that i delve into adobe illustrator . being already familiar with adobe photoshop 's features , tools and " look and feel " , illustrator did n't present a huge , overbearing learning curve . in illustrator , i found the same robust features as coreldraw ... which was n't what impressed me about illustrator . adobe 's intuitive programs , and their ability to interact with one another ... seamlessly ... that is what won me over to illustrator . illustrator 's ability to edit / create pdf 's in their native format ? wow ! exporting layered vector files to photoshop ... with layers intact ? ? ? wow ! ! ! ( i could go on ) now , that being said ... there are still things that i prefer in coreldraw compared to illustrator . the extrude function in corel is much easier to utilize . the powerclip function is more user friendly than illustrator 's " make clipping mask " function . the ability to customize / edit / add shortcut keys is an amazing feature . ( again ... i could go on ) in regards to importing and exporting files from other applications , coreldraw wins , hands down . it boasts a robust set of import and export filters , my favorite being the .eps import filter which lets you import an .eps while converting the fonts to curves during the import . this is a must have if you work with an .eps file created on another computer whose fonts you lack . if i had a dollar for every .eps that pulls into illustrator with fonts blown out ... i 'd be independently wealthy . why illustrator has never implemented this is beyond me . so , to sum it up ... coreldraw is a great program ... but i ca n't imagine it being my only vector drawing program . just like in real life , you need a great team . this program , paired with adobe creative suite , meets my needs perfectly .

software pos 167.txt this is a good software for casual use ( hiking , biking , geocaching ) , but not without issues . on the positive side , it definitely beats all non-digital ( scanned usgs maps ) alternatives . the level of details is good enough ( how many of us need to know topography down to 5 feet ? ) . the fact that maps are digitally generated ( with vectors i believe ) makes all the labels clear at any scale . it has two advantages over its main " digital " competitor , ng topo . first , all of the us is on one dvd for the price of separate state / region cds from ng . and second , it is available . i could not even find ng 's northeast edition anywhere on the web ! one might think nh and me are some obscure corners of the globe and not big tourist destinations . now the few negatives . the exchange feature with gps is flaky . sometimes it takes several tries of unplugging and replugging the cable and restarting the program before it recognizes my garmin . part of it could be that low and mid range gps still have serial connection and are not truly plug-and-play even with com-to-usb adapter ( beats me why garmin ca n't make all their gps with usb in this day and age ) . in any case , regardless of whose fault it is , it is annoying at times not to be able to connect the two smoothly . the second problem i noticed was with the 3-d window . it clearly consumes a lot of memory and crashes my laptop if i do a lot of rapid rescaling . i ended up just closing that window , since it is pretty much for " coolness " and does not add any real topographical value . finally , i had a problem with delorme 's service . i purchased it from amazon with a rebate offer . however , a month after submitting the necessary info i received a card from delorme stating that the bar code i sent was not a upc code . the box only had one bar code on it so i am not sure how i could have made a mistake . they requested that i send a correct one , but with the code cut out and gone , how do they expect me to come up with one ? ! i feel a little bit like that was a cheap way out of paying the rebate but $20 is not worth the time arguing with them over it . i would be interested to hear if anyone else experienced the same problem .

books neg 702.txt this book is more of an advertisement for scoblete 's other books , his writing buddies other books , and his golden touch craps siminar . this book gives no mention of how the reader can acomplish dice control , which is the reason i bought this book . the book is rather a collection of stories . scoblete tells of people he met playing craps but he forgets to tell how to play craps . it would not surprise me at all if the characters in the book are made up , especially the captain , the authors ultimate craps hero . i could n't even finish this book . it was boring and repeated the same type of uninteresting stories all the way through , and left the reader with no knowledge gained . if you are interested in a good casino book i recomend something by avery cardoza or a book published by his company 
music pos 381.txt the progressive metal world better wake up and take note of this outstanding band that hails from poland . these guys are a breath of fresh air with the oversaturated and stagnant progressive metal market that has developed over the past few years . so what do we get for our money you ask , a band comprising of well-schooled musicians , incredible song writing skills and the ability to weave so many different moods and time-passages into each song . there are a few scatterings of influences that are n't a major detraction from the overall mood of the album , namely dream theater , pink floyd , porcupine tree , genesis and anathema . the vocals are clean without a trace of an accent , however they get getting slightly gruff in places but this only compliments the smooth flow of the music . the guitar work is outstanding and david gilmour from pink floyd is a strong reference point here . the rhythm section is outstanding ; especially the drumming and the keyboards give the album a fuller sound with out being too over powering . if you want to start 2007 on a good note then riverside is a worthy investment for sure .

books pos 784.txt moral consciousness and communicative action is the primary anglophone source for habermas 's writings on & quot ; discourse ethics . &quot ; written in the early eighties , this translation , which was published in 1990 , provides a developmental perspective . the focus of the essays moves from habermas 's statements about the role of philosophy today , in & quot ; philosophy as stand-in and interpeter , to his writing on reconstructive social science in general , to his program for a discourse ethics in particular . the final papers address criticisms of this program . the volume suffers a bit from the fact that thomas mccarthy 's introduction is keen to locate habermas 's position vis a vis various contemporary moral-philosophical standpoints , but does not go very far toward locating the whole initiative in the broader canvas of habermas 's overarching social-theoretic project
